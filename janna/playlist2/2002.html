        [Verse 1]<br>
        I will always remember<br>
        The day you kissed my lips<br>
        Light as a feather<br>
        And it went just like this<br>
        No, it's never been better than the summer<br>
        Of 2002 (Ooh)<br><br>
        
        [Verse 2]<br>
        We were only eleven<br>
        But acting like grown-ups<br>
        Like we are in the present<br>
        Drinking from plastic cups<br>
        Singing, "Love is forever and ever"<br>
        Well, I guess that was true (Ooh)<br><br>

        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        Dancin' on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>
        On an old Mustang where we sang<br>
        Songs with all our childhood friends<br>
        And it went like this, say<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        Oops, I got 99 problems, singin' "bye, bye, bye"<br>
        Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>
        Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh<br>
        Paint a picture for you and me<br>
        On the days when we were young, uh<br>
        Singin' at the top of both our lungs<br><br>
        
        [Verse 3]<br>
        Now we're under the covers<br>
        Fast forward to eighteen<br>
        We are more than lovers<br>
        Yeah, we are all we need<br>
        When we're holdin' each other<br>
        I'm taken back to 2002 (Ooh)<br>
        Yeah<br><br>
        
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        Dancin' on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>
        On an old Mustang where we sang<br>
        Songs with all our childhood friends<br>
        And it went like this, say<br><br>

        Oops, I got 99 problems, singin' "bye, bye, bye"<br>
        Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>
        Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh<br>
        Paint a picture for you and me<br>
        On the days when we were young, uh<br>
        Singin' at the top of both our lungs<br>
        On the day we fell in love<br><br>
        
        [Post-Chorus]<br>
        Ooh, ooh<br>
        On the day we fell in love<br>
        Ooh, ooh<br><br>
        
        [Bridge]<br>
        Dancin' on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>
        On an old Mustang where we sang<br>
        Songs with all our childhood friends<br>
        Oh, now<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        Oops, I got 99 problems, singin' "bye, bye, bye"<br>
        Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>
        Better hit me, baby, one more time<br>

        [Post-Chorus]<br>
        Ooh, ooh<br>
        On the day we fell in love<br>
        Ooh, ooh<br>
        On the day we fell in love<br>
        Ooh, ooh<br>
        On the day we fell in love<br>
        Ooh, ooh<br>
        On the day we fell in love, love, love<br><br>
