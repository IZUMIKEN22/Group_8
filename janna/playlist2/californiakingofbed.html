				[Verse 1]<br>
		Chest to chest (Chest to chest)<br>
		Nose to nose (Nose to nose)<br>
		Palm to palm<br>
		We were always just that close (Just that close)<br>
		Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)<br>
		Toe to toe (Toe to toe)<br>
		Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose<br><br>

		[Pre-Chorus]<br>
		So how come when I reach out my finger<br>
		It feels like more than distance between us?<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		In this California king bed<br>
		We're ten thousand miles apart<br>
		I've been California wishing on these stars<br>
		For your heart, for me<br>
		My California king<br><br>

		[Verse 2]<br>
		Eye to eye (Eye to eye)<br>
		Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)<br>
		Side by side<br>
		You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)<br>
		Arm in arm<br>
		Dusk to dawn<br>
		With the curtains drawn<br>
		And a little last night on these sheets<br><br>

		[Pre-Chorus]<br>
		So how come when I reach out my fingers<br>
		It seems like more than distance between us?<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		In this California king bed<br>
		We're ten thousand miles apart<br>
		I've been California wishing on these stars<br>
		For your heart, for me<br>
		My California king<br><br>

		[Bridge]<br>
		Just when I felt like giving up on us<br>
		You turned around and gave me one last touch<br>
		That made everything feel better<br>
		And even then, my eyes got wetter<br>
		So confused, wanna ask you if you love me<br>
		But I don't wanna seem so weak<br>
		Maybe I've been California dreaming<br>
		Hey, hey, hey, hey<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		In this California king bed<br>
		We're ten thousand miles apart<br>
		Been California wishing on these stars<br>
		For your heart, for me<br>
		My California king<br><br>

		[Guitar Solo]<br>
		My California king<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		In this California king bed<br>
		We're ten thousand miles apart<br>
		I've been California wishing on these stars<br>
		For your heart, for me<br><br>
		My California king<br><br>
