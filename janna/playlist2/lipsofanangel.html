        [Verse 1]<br>
        Honey, why you callin’ me so late?<br>
        It’s kinda hard to talk right now<br>
        Honey, why you cryin’? Is everything okay?<br>
        I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud<br><br>
        
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        Oh, well, my girl's in the next room<br>
        Sometimes I wish she was you<br>
        I guess we never really moved on<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        It’s really good to hear your voice<br>
        Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet<br>
        Comin' from the lips of an angel<br>
        Hearin' those words, it makes me weak<br>
        And I never wanna say goodbye<br>
        But girl, you make it hard to be faithful<br>
        With the lips of an angel<br><br>
        
        [Verse 2]<br>
        It‘s funny that you're callin' me tonight<br>
        And yes, I've dreamt of you too<br>
        Does he know you're talkin’ to me<br>
        Will it start a fight?<br>
        No, I don't think she has a clue<br><br>
        
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        Oh, well, my girl's in the next room<br>
        Sometimes I wish she was you<br>
        I guess we never really moved on<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        It’s really good to hear your voice<br>
        Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet<br>
        Comin' from the lips of an angel<br>
        Hearin' those words, it makes me weak<br>
        And I never wanna say goodbye<br>
        But girl, you make it hard to be faithful<br>
        With the lips of an angel<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        It's really good to hear your voice<br>
        Sayin' my name, it sounds so sweet<br>
        Comin' from the lips of an angel<br>
        Hearin' those words, it makes me weak<br>
        And I never wanna say goodbye<br>
        But girl, you make it hard to be faithful<br>
        With the lips of an angel<br>
        (Never wanna say goodbye)<br>
        But girl, you make it hard to be faithful<br>
        With the lips of an angel<br><br>
