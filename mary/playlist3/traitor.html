		[Intro]<br>
		Ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
		Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah<br><br>

		[Verse 1]<br>
		Brown guilty eyes and<br>
		Little white lies, yeah<br>
		I played dumb, but I always knew<br>
		That you talked to her, maybe did even worse<br>
		I kept quiet so I could keep you<br><br>


		[Pre-Chorus]<br>
		And ain't it funny how you ran to her<br>
		The second that we called it quits?<br>
		And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?<br>
		Now it sure as hell don't look like it<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		You betrayed me<br>
		And I know that you'll never feel sorry<br>
		For the way I hurt, yeah<br>
		You talked to her when we were together<br>
		Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter<br>
		It took you two weeks to go off and date her<br>
		Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor<br><br>

		[Verse 2]<br>
		Now you bring her around just to shut me down<br>
		Show her off like she's a new trophy<br>
		And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you<br>
		Could fall in love with somebody that quickly<br><br>

		[Pre-Chorus]<br>
		And ain't it funny? All the twisted games<br>
		All the questions you used to avoid<br>
		Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up<br>
		And you told me I was paranoid?<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		You betrayed me<br>
		And I know that you'll never feel sorry<br>
		For the way I hurt, yeah<br>
		You talked to her when we were together<br>
		Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter<br>
		It took you two weeks to go off and date her<br>
		Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor<br><br>

		[Bridge]<br>
		(Ah-ah-ah)<br>
		God, I wish that you had thought this through<br>
		Before I went and fell in love with you<br>
		(Ah-ah-ah)<br>
		When she's sleepin' in the bed we made<br>
		Don't you dare forget about the way<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		You betrayed me<br>
		'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry<br>
		For the way I hurt, yeah<br>
		You talked to her when we were together<br>
		You gave me your word, but that didn't matter<br>
		It took you two weeks to go off and date her<br>
		Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still, you're still a traitor<br>
		(Ah-ah-ah)<br>
		Yeah, you're still a traitor<br><br>

		[Outro]<br>
		Ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
		God, I wish that you had thought this through<br>
		Before I went and fell in love with you
