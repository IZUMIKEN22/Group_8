		[Verse 1]<br>
		Watch the sun rise along the coast<br>
		As we're both getting old<br>
		I can't describe what I'm feeling<br>
		And all I know is we're going home<br>
		So please don't let me go<br>
		Don't let me go<br><br>
		
		[Chorus]<br>
		And if it's right, I don't care how long it takes<br>
		As long as I'm with you I've got a smile on my face<br>
		Save your tears, it'll be okay<br>
		All I know is you're here with me<br><br>
		
		[Verse 2]<br>
		Watch the sun rise as we're getting old, oh oh<br>
		I can't describe oh, oh<br>
		I wish I could live through every memory again<br>
		Just one more time before we float off in the wind<br>
		And all the time we spent<br>
		Waiting for the light to take us in<br>
		Have been the greatest moments of my life<br><br>
		
		[Chorus]<br>
		I don't care how long it takes<br>
		As long as I'm with you I've got a smile on my face<br>
		Save your tears, it'll be okay<br>
		You're here with me<br><br>
