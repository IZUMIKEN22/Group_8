        [Chorus]<br>
        It's you, it's always you<br>
        If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you<br>
        It's you, it's always you<br>
        Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you<br>
        So please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart<br>
        I know how it starts, trust me, I've been broken before<br>
        Don't break me again, I am delicate<br>
        Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before<br><br>
        
        [Verse 1]<br>
        I've been broken, yeah, I know how it feels<br>
        To be open and then find out your love isn't real<br>
        I'm still hurting, yeah, I'm hurting inside<br>
        I'm so scared to fall in love, but if it's you, then I'll try<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        It's you, it's always you<br>
        If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you<br>
        It's you, it's always you<br>
        Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you<br>
        So please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart<br>
        I know how it starts, trust me, I've been broken before<br>
        Don't break me again, I am delicate<br>
        Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before<br><br>
        
        [Verse 2]<br>
        I know I'm not the best at choosing lovers (Oh)<br>
        We both know my past speaks for itself (For itself)<br>
        If you don't think that we're right for each other (Baby, no)<br>
        Then please don't let history repeat itself<br>
        'Cause I want you, yeah, I want you, yeah<br>
        There's nothing else I want<br>
        'Cause I want you, yeah, I want you, yeah<br>
        And you're the only thing I want<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        It's you, it's always you<br>
        If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you<br>
        It's you, it's always you<br>
        Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you<br>
        So please don't break my heart, don't tear me apart<br>

        Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before<br><br>
        
        [Outro]<br>
        Baby, I want you, baby, I want you<br>
        Baby, I want you, baby, I want you<br>
        Baby, I want you, baby, I want you<br>
        You, you, 'cause I want you<br>
        Baby, I want you, baby, I want you<br>
        Baby, I want you, baby, I want you<br>
        Baby, I want you, baby, I want you<br>
        You, you<br><br>
