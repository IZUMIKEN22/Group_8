		[Verse 1]<br>
		There I was again tonight<br>
		Forcing laughter, faking smiles<br>
		Same old tired, lonely place<br>
		Walls of insincerity<br>
		Shifting eyes and vacancy<br>
		Vanished when I saw your face<br>
		All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you<br><br>

		[Verse 2]<br>
		Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"<br>
		Across the room, your silhouette<br>
		Starts to make its way to me<br>
		The playful conversation starts<br>
		Counter all your quick remarks<br>
		Like passing notes in secrecy<br>
		And it was enchanting to meet you<br>
		All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
		I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>
		I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
		I was enchanted to meet you<br><br>

		[Verse 3]<br>
		The lingering question kept me up<br>
		2AM, who do you love?<br>
		I wonder 'til I'm wide awake<br>
		Now I'm pacing back and forth<br>
		Wishing you were at my door<br>
		I'd open up and you would say<br>
		"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"<br>
		All I know is I was enchanted to meet you<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
		I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>
		I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
		This night is flawless, don't you let it go<br>
		I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br>
		I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
		I was enchanted to meet you<br><br>

		[Guitar Solo]<br><br>

		[Bridge]<br>
		This is me praying that<br>
		This was the very first page<br>
		Not where the storyline ends<br>
		My thoughts will echo your name<br>
		Until I see you again<br>
		These are the words I held back<br>
		As I was leaving too soon<br>
		I was enchanted to meet you<br>
		Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
		Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br>
		Please don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)<br>
		Please don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)<br><br>

		[Chorus]<br>
		This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
		I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>
		I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
		This night is flawless (Please don't be in love with someone else)<br>
		Don't you let it go<br>
		I'm wonderstruck (Please don't have somebody waiting on you)<br>
		Dancing around all alone<br>
		I'll spend forever (Please don't be in love with someone else)<br>
		Wondering if you knew<br>
		I was enchanted to meet you<br><br>

		[Outro]<br>
		Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
		Please don't have somebody waiting on you
