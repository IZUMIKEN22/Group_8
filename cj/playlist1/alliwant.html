            [Verse 1]<br>
            I found a guy, told me I was a star<br>
            He held the door, held my hand in the dark<br>
            And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face<br>
            Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?<br><br>
            
            [Verse 2]<br>
            And there's one more boy, he's from my past<br>
            We fell in love, but it didn't last<br>
            'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away<br>
            And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway<br>
            And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you<br><br>
            
            [Chorus]<br>
            All I want is love that lasts<br>
            Is all I want too much to ask?<br>
            Is it something wrong with me?<br>
            All I want is a good guy<br>
            Are my expectations far too high?<br>
            Try my best, but what can I say?<br>
            All I have is myself at the end of the day<br>
            But shouldn't that be enough for me?<br><br>
            
            [Bridge]<br>
            Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
            And I miss the days when I was young and naive<br>
            I thought the perfect guy would come and find me<br>
            Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily<br><br>
            
            [Chorus]<br>
            All I want is love that lasts<br>
            Is all I want too much to ask?<br>
            Is it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh<br>
            All I want is a good guy<br>
            Are my expectations far too high?<br>
            Try my best but what can I say?<br>
            All I have is myself at the end of the day<br>
            And all I want is for that to be okay<br><br>
