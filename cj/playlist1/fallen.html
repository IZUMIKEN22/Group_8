        [Verse 1]<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen?<br>
        And I like the way you say my name<br>
        My heart skips a beat when I hear you calling<br>
        And I like that it won't go away<br><br>
        
        [Verse 2]<br>
        But never mind, don't wanna give you any trouble<br>
        Never mind, never mind<br>
        I'm okay with being by your side for as long as I can hide<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen?<br><br>
        
        [Verse 3]<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen?<br>
        A heart shaped arrow through my chest<br>
        I'll make your breakfast every morning<br>
        And pick you up when you're a mess<br><br>
        
        [Verse 4]<br>
        I know that it won't ever stop<br>
        You know I'll be there when you call me whеther you like it or not<br>
        Without a warning, now I'm falling for this picture on my phonе<br>
        But don't mind me I'm just falling, I'll get back up on my own<br>
        Please don't say my name, help me put out this flame<br>
        I'd rather hold onto this feeling that you don't even believe in<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen?<br><br>
        
        [Instrumental]<br><br>
        
        [Bridge]<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen?<br>
        (Never mind, never mind, never mind)<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen?<br>
        (Never mind, never mind, never mind)<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen?<br>
        (Never mind, never mind, never mind)<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen?<br>
        (Never mind, never mind, never mind)<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen? (Oh, never mind)<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen? (Oh, never mind)<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen? (Oh, never mind)<br>
        What if I told you that I've fallen? (Oh, never mind)<br><br>
        
        [Outro]<br>
        I said never mind (I shouldn't tell you that I've fallen)<br><br>
