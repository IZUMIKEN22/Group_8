        <br>[Verse 1]<br>
        Maybe it's the way you say my name<br>
        Maybe it's the way you play your game<br>
        But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you<br>
        But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you<br><br>

        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime<br>
        And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine<br><br>

        [Chorus]<br>
        'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
        Wishin' on every one that you'd be mine, mine<br>
        And I see forever in your eyes<br>
        I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br><br>

        [Post-Chorus]<br>
        Wishin' on dandelions all of the time<br>
        Prayin' to God that one day you'll be mine<br>
        Wishin' on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br><br>

        [Verse 2]<br>
        I think that you are the one for me<br>
        'Cause it gets so hard to breathe<br>
        When you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free<br>
        When you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy<br><br>

        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime<br>
        And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine<br><br>

        [Chorus]<br>
        'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
        Wishin' on every one that you'd be mine, mine<br>
        And I see forever in your eyes<br>
        I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br><br>

        [Post-Chorus]<br>
        Wishin' on dandelions all of the time<br>
        Prayin' to God that one day you'll be mine<br>
        Wishin' on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br><br>

        [Bridge]<br>
        Dandelion into the wind you go<br>
        Won't you let my darling know?<br>
        Dandelion into the wind you go<br>
        Won't you let my darling know that<br><br>

        [Chorus]<br>
        I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
        Wishin' on every one that you'd be mine, mine<br>
        And I see forever in your eyes<br>
        I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br><br>

        [Post-Chorus]<br>
        Wishin' on dandelions all of the time<br>
        Prayin' to God that one day you'll be mine<br>
        Wishin' on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br><br>

        [Outro]<br>
        I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
        Wishin' on every one that you'd be mine, mine<br><br>
