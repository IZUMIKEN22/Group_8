        [Verse 1]<br>
        Oh, I'm obsessed<br>
        With the way your head is layin' on my chest<br>
        How you love the things I hate about myself that no one knows <br>
        But with you, I see hope again<br>
        Oh, I'm a mess<br>
        When I overthink the little things in my head<br>
        You seem to always help me catch my breath<br>
        But then I lose it again<br>
        When I look at you, that's the end<br><br>
        
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        And why do I get so nervous when I look into your eyes?<br>
        Butterflies can't stop me fallin' for you<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        And darling, this is more than anything I felt before<br>
        You're everything that I want<br>
        But I didn't think I'd find<br>
        Someone who was worth the wait<br>
        Of all the years of my heartbreak<br>
        But I know now I found the one I love<br><br>
        
        [Verse 2]<br>
        And I love the way<br>
        You can never find the right things to say<br>
        And you can't sit still an hour in a day<br>
        I'm so in love, let's run away because us is enough<br><br>
        
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        And why do I get so nervous when I look into your eyes?<br>
        And butterflies can't stop me fallin' for you<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        And darling, this is more than anything I felt before<br>
        You're everything that I want<br>
        But I didn't think I'd find<br>
        Someone who was worth the wait<br>
        Of all the years of my heartbreak<br>
        But I know now I found the one<br><br>
        
        [Bridge]<br>
        Come close, let me be home for anything<br>
        Good or bad, I know it's worth it, woah, ooh-woah<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        And darling, this is more than anything I felt before<br>
        You're everything that I want<br>
        But I didn't think I'd find<br>
        Someone who was worth the wait<br>
        Of all the years of my heartbreak<br>
        But I know now I found the one I love<br>
