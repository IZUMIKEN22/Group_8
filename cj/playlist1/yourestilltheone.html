        [Intro]<br>
        When I first saw you, I saw love<br>
        And the first time you touched me, I felt love<br>
        And after all this time<br>
        You're still the one I love<br>
        Mmm, yeah<br><br>
        
        [Verse 1]<br>
        Looks like we made it<br>
        Look how far we've come, my baby<br>
        We mighta took the long way<br>
        We knew we'd get there someday<br><br>
        
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        They said, "I bet they'll never make it"<br>
        But just look at us holdin' on<br>
        We're still together, still goin' strong<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        (You're still the one) You're still the one I run to<br>
        The one that I belong to<br>
        You're still the one I want for life<br>
        (You're still the one) You're still the one that I love<br>
        The only one I dream of<br>
        You're still the one I kiss goodnight<br><br>
        
        [Verse 2]<br>
        Ain't nothin' better<br>
        We beat the odds together<br>
        I'm glad we didn't listen<br>
        Look at what we would be missin'<br><br>
        
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        They said, "I bet they'll never make it"<br>
        But just look at us holdin' on<br>
        We're still together, still goin' strong<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        (You're still the one) You're still the one I run to<br>
        The one that I belong to<br>
        You're still the one I want for life<br>
        (You're still the one) You're still the one that I love<br>
        The only one I dream of<br>
        You're still the one I kiss goodnight<br>
        You're still the one<br><br>
        
        [Interlude]<br>
        (Ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>
        Yeah<br><br>
        
        [Chorus]<br>
        (You're still the one) You're still the one I run to<br>
        The one that I belong to<br>
        You're still the one I want for life, oh, yeah<br>
        (You're still the one) You're still the one that I love<br>
        The only one I dream of<br>
        You're still the one I kiss goodnight<br><br>
        
        [Outro]<br>
        I'm so glad we made it<br>
        Look how far we've come, my baby<br><br>
